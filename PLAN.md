// Plan

- [ ] Need to optimize the entire app for mobile so that it can be played on the go.
- [x] Show the zone that a defender is covering and if an offensive player ends up in that zone, they are not considered open.
- [x] Add man coverage as a defensive player assignment
- [ ] Encorporate a football into the field of play, the quarterback should start with it and if there is a receiver that is not covered the football should travel to the open receiver to show where the completion is coming from.
- [ ] The receiver names don't correspond to the labels on the position, so when a round is completed the open receiver is shown in the success message but we don't know which receiver that is (WR3 vs WR label)
- [ ] The deep 1/3 zones for the DB's in cover 3 are pushed to far that it is extending pass the viewport. Also make sure the seems (around the hashes) are open in cover 3 so make the deep zones thinner so they don't cover those seems
